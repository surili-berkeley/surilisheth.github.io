      <section>
        <p>I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>. 
	</p>
	<p> My research focuses on gender-based violence, paternalistic institutions, and women's behavior in the Global South, with a regional focus on South Asia. I used mixed methods in my research, including experiments, ethnographic and archival, and machine learning methods.
	</p>	     
	<p> My research has been supported by the APSA Minority Fellowship, the Foreign Language Area Studies (FLAS) Dissertation Fellowship, 3ie. It has also been supported by grants from the Institute of International Studies (IIS), the Center on Contemporary India (CCI), the Center for Race and Gender (CRG), and the Center on the Politics of Development (CPD) at UC Berkeley. 
	</p>	
	<p> I hold an MPA in International Development (MPA/ID) from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a B.S. in Economics and Political Science from The Ohio State University. I have worked as a development economics and policy professional for organizations such as J-PAL, IDinsight, IMAGO Global Grassroots, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, and the World Bank, as well as with organizations such as SEWA, Transform Rural India, and the Ministry of Rural Development in Andhra Pradesh.
