      <section>
        <p>I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>. I research gendered understandings of: the political economy of local development, political inequality, and the consequences of climate change using mixed (in-depth qualitative, experimental, and machine-learning) methods. My dissertation project investigates the role of state and community control of natural resources in entrenching patriarchal gender relations. My research is located in the Global South, with a focus on India.
        </p>
        <p>I am a two-time Fulbright fellowship recipient: I received the Fulbright DDRA Fellowship for 2025 and was a Fulbright-Nehru Fellow in Pune, India in 2018. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College. Outside of the PhD, I’ve worked for the Impact Data and Evidence Aggregation Library project at the World Bank, the Research, Evaluation and Data Team at IDinsight, the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State, Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, and Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal.
