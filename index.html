      <section>
        <p>I’m a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center on the Politics of Development</a>. My dissertation committee members are Pradeep Chhibber, Thad Dunning, Cecilia Mo, and Jennifer Bussell.
	</p>
	<p> My research examines gender-based violence, paternalistic institutions, and women's behavior, particularly in South Asia and the United States. I employ mixed methods, including experiments, ethnography, archival research, and machine learning.
	</p>	     
	<p> My work has been supported by the APSA Minority Fellowship, the Foreign Language Area Studies (FLAS) Dissertation Fellowship, and 3ie. It has also been supported by grants from the Institute of International Studies (IIS), the Center on Contemporary India (CCI), the Center for Race and Gender (CRG), and the Center on the Politics of Development (CPD) at UC Berkeley. 
	</p>	
	<p> I hold an MPA in International Development (MPA/ID) from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and a B.S. in Economics and Political Science from The Ohio State University. I have worked as a development economics and policy professional for organizations such as J-PAL, IDinsight, IMAGO Global Grassroots, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, and the World Bank, as well as with organizations such as SEWA, Transform Rural India, and the Ministry of Rural Development in Andhra Pradesh.

        <h3>Working Papers</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Domestic Violence Claim-Making in India </b>
          <br> Dissertation project. Using mixed methods, this project investigates why and how women navigate making institutional claims in situations of domestic violence. I use results from a door-to-door survey experiment and survey (n=2000), fifteen months of ethnographic observation at and around an autonomous women's organization that provides counseling services to women and their families in situations of violence, and in-deth archival analyses and interviews with counselors to trace the institutional trajectories of approximately ~600 family dispute cases filed over 20 years at the organization.
